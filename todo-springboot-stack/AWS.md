Host their websites,
System Administrator's responsibility.
Arranging all the entire things.

1. Choose the Data center/ Hosting provider
2. You need to typically send them enquiry about your requirements
3. They will contact you and price negotiations

DataCenter Model is Challenging:
Use case 1: Due to some big promotion, server capacity needs to be increased from 4GB RAM to 32GB RAM

DataCenter Provider way:- Buy a 32GB RAM Stick & install it onto your server

Hosting Provider way:- 
Raise a support ticket and expect response within 15min to 12hours.
Get the DC guys to resize your server.

Cloud way:- Stop the server & change the instance size.

Cloud computing is a model in which computing resources are available as a service.

# 3Important characteristic of Cloud Computing:

*	On-demand & Self serviced	[Any time launch without manual intervention]
*	Elasticity	[Can scale up and down anytime]
*	Measured Service	[Pay what you use]

## Cloud Computing Models

There are 3 types of Cloud Computing models.

-- Software as Service	[Google Docs, Office365]
--
-- Platform as Service	[Google App Engine]
--
-- Infrastructure as Service [AWS, Linode, Digital Ocean]
--

AWS is one of the most comprehensive Cloud Provider
It provides all the type of cloud models,
- SaaS
- PaaS
- IaaS

But if you just depend on AWS for everything, you will loose lot of money.

## Architecture of Cloud
[Cloud is not an Clouds]

Cloud from behind the scenes is data center only. - Virtualization Environment. 

Virtualization allows us to run multiple OS on a single hardware.
There are many virtualization softwares available like:
1. VMware Workstation / vSphere
2. KVM
3. XEN
4. VirtualBox

## On-Demand & Self Service
[Cloud is not unlimited]
1. A person can provision resources in cloud whenever needed, without requiring any human interaction with service provider.
2. On-demand make self service with automation possible in a seemingless way.

Challenges

On-Demand does not always means that you will be able to launch instances at any given point of time.
Even a cloud provider has limits, though it might be high, these limits are definitely reached.

## Elasticity
[Rubber band]
1. Elasticity deals with adding and removing capacity, whenever it is needed in the environment.
2. Capacity generally refers to mostly processing and memory
3. It is like a rubber band.

# Scalability

Vertical Scalability: Adding or removing resource for existing servers.
Horizontal Scalability: Adding or removing instances from pool like cluster farm.

# Auto Scalability

* Scaling servers on-demand is the real deal
* Can be achieved through Auto Scaling functionality

Usecase Scenario:
-> Whenever CPU load > 70%, scale up to two more servers
-> Whenever CPU load < 30%, scale down by two servers
